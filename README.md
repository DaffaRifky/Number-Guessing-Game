Project Title: Guess the number

Description:
this is my first project after entering the world of web dev and is still experimenting with it. As the title suggest this is a number guessing game/challange where you input your Min and Max number value and set the decimals range value (optional, and still planning to add more optional settings) and when you pressed the "Generate" button it will pick a random Min Number, random Max Number, and a random number between them that you have to guessed and type untill you get the correct answer. Im sorry if its a bit confusing, its basicly a pure raw idea i get in my mind after learning some basics of web dev. still have no plan to deploy it so feel free to download the project and do whatever you want with it lol.
